# Data-Ripper
Small text parsing tool, with the intention of stripping specific values (mainly usernames only) from text-database dumps to avoid releasing confidential information when reporting on users affected.
I was far too lazy to code a proper GUI, so I apologize for the ugly code. I coded this in 2014~, so I again apologize for bad code.
